node-storenvy
=============

A Node client to access the Storenvy API

Currently only supporting API key authentication.

##Working
- ~~Adding more endpoints.~~
  - all GETs are done
- ~~Add OAuth 2 authentication.~~
  - done, but the oauth dance is browser-based, so I'll figure out a flow for that.
- Add POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints
- Figure out public tests (private testing for the moment)
